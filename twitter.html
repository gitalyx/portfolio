                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>The future of Twitter/X is uncertain since Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter/X in 2022. Since then, the platform has undergone significant changes, including layoffs and "free speech". Through "free speech", Musk has allowed Donald Trump back on the platform and also the change of the algorithm to maximize the views of his own tweets. I am not going to enumerate all the changes that have been made but all of them are some good changes some bad and most are really weird that makes you ask why.</p>

                <h3>New alternatives</h3>
                <p>Since the changes, people have started to look for alternatives to Twitter/X. Some of the most popular ones are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Threads</li>
                    <li>Bluesky</li>
                    <li>Mastodon</li>
                </ul>
                <p>But let's be honest, Threads is just a copy of twitter from 2018 with all of the problems that Twitter was having back then, thats why after a few months of its launch, it was already dead. Bluesky is better than Threads and it has a better chance of surviving because it is not just a copy of Twitter and its also decentralized. Mastodon is also a good alternative but it is not as good as Bluesky because it is not as popular and easier to use. But only time will tell which one will survive and possible be the new Twitter/X.</p>

                <h3>User Reactions</h3>
                <p>As a Twitter/X user, I can say that I am not happy with the changes that have been made. Since the acquisition of Twitter/X by Elon Musk, i have seen more far right posts and conspiracy like the deep state and more. I am not saying that i am a leftist or a rightist because i want to be as close as neutral as possible, that is why i am not happy with the changes and other people think the same, thats why i like Bluesky have settings to not see or see things like politics and other things.</p>

                <h3>Potential Future Scenarios</h3>
                <p>As we look to the future, several potential scenarios emerge for Twitter/X. The future of Twitter/X is uncertain and it is hard to predict what will happen. But one thing is for sure, Twitter/X will not be the same but if someone ask me what will happen to Twitter/X, i would say that it will die and be forgotten like Myspace if Elon Musk will do more bad changes. But if someone would buy Twitter/X, and manage to recover it to be better maybe it will survive.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>This blog is just my opinion and thoughts and there are many other things that i didn't mention or i didn't say the correct things. But one thing is for sure, Twitter/X will probably die under Elon Musk's leadership and if it does, it will be the end of an era, and maybe Bluesky will replace it as the new social media platform.</p>
